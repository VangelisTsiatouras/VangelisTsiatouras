### 👋 Hi, I'm Vangelis Tsiatouras

I'm a Software Engineer from Greece who is really passionate about Computer Science. Currently, I'm graduate student at M.Sc. Computer Science - Data, Information and Knowledge Management @ University of Athens.

⚡️ I'm experienced on implementing backend RESTful APIs with SQL or noSQL databases.

🌱 Currently I'm learning Graph DBs such as Neo4J, and Data Pipelining using [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/)

☁️ Also I have enrolled to AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner program in order to dive into Cloud Services for Big Data.

🤖 Sometimes I like to implement small Machine Learning projects for fun.

🏞️ At my free time, I love to go for hiking and at winter maybe you will find me at some snowy slope ⛷️

Also you can find me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vangelis-tsiatouras/)
